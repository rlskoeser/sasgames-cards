<p>Tell an interactive story using the pictures or words from a card.
To play deal everyone 3 cards and then flip a random card from the deck to start. The first person starts with:
<blockquote class="quote">Once upon a timeâ€¦</blockquote>
and starts a story that has something to do with the flipped card. After a sentence or 2, the next person in the circle will lay a card from their hand down and add to the story. After 3 times around the table, the last person wraps up the story with their last card.</p>
