<p>Shuffle the deck and deal out three cards face up on the table. Everyone silently identify commonalities between the cards and pick out which is the “black sheep” that doesn’t match. After everyone has selected their black sheep, count to three and then everyone points to the card they chose as the black sheep. Everyone defends their choice and explain the commonality they saw and why the card they selected as the black sheep.  Play a few rounds of this simple game to prepare you for the game Word Connections, which is all about finding connections between cards.</p>
