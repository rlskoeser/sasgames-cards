<p>Be the first to get rid of your cards by following suit or rank to the discard pile. Youngest player goes first. Deal 5 cards to each player and then start a discard pile by flipping the next card. The first player needs to play a card that matches either the suit (hearts, spades, clubs, or diamonds) or rank (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, etc). When you play a card, <b>share something to the group</b> about the word or picture. Start playing clockwise around the table. If you can't play, draw a card and end your turn. The following cards are special:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>King</b>: Reverse the direction of play</li>
    <li><b>7</b>: Skip the next player</li>
    <li><b>2</b>: Next player must draw 2 cards and skip a turn</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are down to your last card, you must say “One card left” or draw a penalty card.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the first one out. They get to come up with a new rule for future games. Rules could include adding to the special cards, forcing a motion or action if something happens, or any creative thing you can think of.</p>
