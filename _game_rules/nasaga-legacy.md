    <div class="tabcontent">The object of the game is to get rid of all your cards first. On your turn, you play a card to the discard pile that matches either suit or card rank. Deal every player 7 cards to begin. The player to the right of the dealer goes first. </div>

    <div class="tabcontent">The object of the game is to end your turn with all your cards in valid sets. A valid set consists of either a 3 (or more) of a kind of a card rank, or a run of 3 (or more) cards such as 4,5,6 of the same suit. On your turn draw a card from either the deck or the top card of the discard pile and end your turn by discarding a card to the discard pile. You must discard on your winning hand. </div>

    <div class="tabcontent">The object of this trick-taking game is to score the fewest points. Deal out all the cards evenly to the players, with the remaining cards (if any) face-down in the center. The player with the 2 of "Dice" plays first and must play the 2 of "Dice". In clock-wise order each player plays a card and must follow suit, if they have that suit. The highest card of the originally played suit takes the trick and puts the played cards in their score pile. The winner of that trick starts the next round. In this game the "Arts" suit cards are all worth one point. The first player to take a trick with a point card, takes in the center cards (if any) and can look at them privately. After all cards have been played, tally up each players score. If a player takes all the points for the round, they "shoot the moon" and instead give that number to every other player and score a zero for the round. Play additional rounds until one player has over 50 points, then the lowest score wins.

    <div class="tabcontent">Give every player an equal amount of betting chips. The object is to gather the most chips. Deal each player 5 cards. A round of betting can happen here and if you don't match a bet, you must fold out of the hand. The players can then exchange up to 4 cards for new cards. A second round of betting occurs. After all betting is done, the players who haven't folded out reveal their hands and the highest hand wins. The order of hands is: 5 of a Kind, Straight flush, 4 of a kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, 3 of a Kind, 2 pairs of cards, 1 pair of cards.</div>
