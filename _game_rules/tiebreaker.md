<p>Play this quick game if any other game you have ends up as a tie.  Turn the next card from the deck face up on the table and then tell the group a true story about yourself that involves the word on the card. Then someone on the other team (or the other tied winner)  tell a true story that involves themselves and the card. If you can weave in the Bride or Groom in your (true) story, all the better. The other players choose a winner from the two stories. If they declare a tie, play another round of Tie-Breaker.</p>
