    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>While you wait for your tablemates to come, look through your deck of cards and pick a card that resonates with you. </p>

<h2>Word Connections</h2>

<div class="content">

<p>In Word Connections you will be making connections between random words and trying to get your team to guess your words in the fewest clues before the other team gets their words.</p>

<h3>Set up</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Break into 2 teams (they can be of any size, from teams of 2 to teams of 10). Also, unequal size teams work as well, one team can be 4 people and the other team of 5 people. </p>

<p>Shuffle the cards and deal out 16 random face-up cards in a 4 x 4 grid. These 16 words are the pool of words that the teams need to clue. One team will have 6 of these words, the other team will have the other 6 words, and there will be 4 neutral cards. </p>

<p>Choose a player from each side and have them sit next to each other and look at the Word Connections game on their phone. Choose who will be Blue (and go first) and who will be Green (and go second). They will hit the “Randomize” button and it will randomize the grid on the phone to have 5 blue cards and 5 green cards and 2 neutral gray cards. </p>

<p>The Blue player will first give a word or word-phrase (no more than 2 words) clue that ties some of the words assigned to you together. After giving their clue, the Blue player will say “This applies to # tiles” (where # is the number of tiles that you are hoping your team will guess. </p>

<p>The Blue team will then debate about what they think the clue means. When they have decided on the first card to select, they will touch the card as their guess. The Blue clue-giver should be straight-faced and not react to the discussion and not make any move towards the cards until they lock in their guesses. The clue-giver should always look back at the phone to confirm then remove the card and either put it in front of them (if it was a blue card), in front of the green clue-giver if it is a green card, or in a neutral pile if it was a gray card. If a blue card was successfully selected, the blue team can choose to continue and make an additional guess. As long as you continue to get successes the blue team can keep guessing. </p>

<p>When a neutral or the other player’s color is selected that clue-round ends. In this case, the Green clue-giver would have a chance to give their word or word phrase clue and their number of cards that it refers to.</p>

<h3>Rules about clues that can be given. </h3>
<div class="content">
<ul>
<li>Your word or word phrase clue must be about the meaning of the words or something about the picture on the card. Your clue should not be about the position of the cards (Left side, for example is an invalid clue), about the suit or number of the card (Diamonds, Spades, or Jack, for example is an invalid clue), or about the starting letter of the card (P, for example, to clue in Paddleboarding and Palindrome in an invalid clue). </li>
<li>Your clues must be English words. No fair giving a French word to clue a card, unless it is a common expression.</li>
<li>You can’t say any form of the words that are currently on the board.</li>
<li>If you give a 2-word phrase, the words must go together and not be 2 random separate clues to 2 separate words. If there is a common two-word word phrase that happens to give different information, than the clue is fine. For example, Sourpatch Kids is a common phrase that might get someone to select Apple Cider Vinegar and Ender’s Game -- though it could totally fail as a clue as well. </li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, for the game to be most successful, the clue-giver should not give non-verbal clues and should remain straight-faced through the game. When an unexpected card is selected, they should not reveal verbally or non-verbally that the clue was given was what they were thinking about. </p>

<p>Both teams will be able to give the same amount of clues. If the Blue team gets their 6th card, their turn ends and the Green team gets one last chance to tie. If the Green team is the first team to 6, the game just ends with them as the winner (both teams would have had an equal number of clues, since Blue always starts).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the game ends tied, then you should play a quick game of Tie-Breaker.</p>
</div>

<div class="game-rules" id="tiebreaker">

<input id="tiebreaker-toggle" type="checkbox" class="checkbox-toggle" />
<label for="tiebreaker-toggle" class="fa"></label>

<h2>Tie-Breaker</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>Play this quick game if any other game you have ends up as a tie.  Select the next card of the deck and then tell the group a true story about yourself that involves the word on the card. Someone on the other team (or other tied winner) tells a true story that involves themselves and the card. If you can weave in the Bride or Groom in your (true) story, all the better. The other players choose a winner from the two stories. If they declare a tie, place another round of Tie-Breaker.</p>

    <input id="and-then-toggle" type="checkbox" class="checkbox-toggle" />
    <label for="and-then-toggle" class="fa"></label>

    <h2>And Then…</h2>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Tell an interactive story using the pictures or words from a card.
    To play deal everyone 2 cards and then flip a random card from the deck to start. The first person starts with:
    <blockquote class="quote">Once upon a time…</blockquote>
    and starts a story that has something to do with the flipped card. After a sentence or 2, the next person will lay a card from their hand down and add to the story. After 2 times around the table, the last person wraps up the story with their last card.</p>

<input id="blacksheep-toggle" type="checkbox" class="checkbox-toggle" />
<label for="blacksheep-toggle" class="fa"></label>

<h2>Black Sheep</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>Shuffle the deck and deal out 3 cards to the table. Everyone silently identifies commonalities between the cards and picks out which is the black sheep” that doesn’t match. After everyone has selected their black sheep, count to 3 and then everyone points to the black sheep that they identified. Everyone defends their choice for what the commonality that they saw was and why the card they selected was the black sheep.</p>
