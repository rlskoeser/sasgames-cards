<h1 class="page-heading">Johnny and Abi Wedding cards</h1>

<h2>Thank you! Xie Xie! Gracias! Multumesc!</h2>

<p>Thank you for celebrating the marriage of Johnny and Abigail Lui. These cards are full of things that Johnny and Abi love as well as moments that they have shared together.</p>

<p>We hope you have fun learning more about Johnny and Abi as you interact with the cards through these games. When you pull out your wedding favor cards in the future to replay some of the games, take a moment to pray for Johnny and Abi's marriage.</p>

    <h2>Welcome to the Table!</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Look through your deck of cards and pick a card or two that resonates with you. Introduce yourself to someone new at the wedding and share the card you chose why you chose it. When everyone is seated at the table, go around and share your card with the entire table. </p>

<h2>Black Sheep</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>Shuffle the deck and deal out 3 cards to the table. Everyone silently identifies commonalities between the cards and picks out which is the black sheep” that doesn’t match. After everyone has selected their black sheep, count to 3 and then everyone points to the black sheep that they identified. Everyone defends their choice for what the commonality that they saw was and why the card they selected was the black sheep.  Play a few rounds of this simple game to prepare you for the game Word Connections which is all about finding connections between cards.</p>

<p>Make connections between random cards and try to get your team to guess your cards in the fewest clues before the other team gets all of their cards.</p>

<h3>Set up</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Break into 2 teams of any size (at least 2 players per team).</p>

<p>Shuffle the cards and deal out 16 random face-up cards in a 4 x 4 grid. These 16 cards are the pool of words that the teams need to clue. Each team will have 6 of these cards, with 4 neutral cards.</p>

<p>Choose a player from each side and have them sit next to each other and look at the board above. The “Randomize” button will generate a new set of team cards assignments. The “Perspective” button tilts the board on the screen, which may be useful to ensure that both clue-givers are looking at the board the same way. The “Fullscreen” button will make the board fullscreen and hide the randomize button to avoid accidentally changing the layout mid-game.</p>

<p>Choose who will be Blue (and go first) and who will be Green (and go second). Hit the “Randomize” button to get a new set of card assignments.  Only the two cluegivers should look at the phone so that only they know the cards that belong to their team. </p>

<p>Starting with the Blue clue-giver, give your teammates a one word or two-word phrase clue that applies to some of your assigned cards. After giving the clue, say “This applies to # cards” (where # is the number of cards that you  hope your team will guess based on your clue).</p>

<p>The Blue team guessers can then discuss what they think the clue means and which cards it refers to. When they have decided on the first card to select, touch the card to indicate their guess. The clue-giver should be straight-faced and not react to the discussion or make any move towards the cards until the guessers lock in their choice. The clue-giver should always look back at the board to confirm then remove the card and either put it in front of them (if it belongs to their team), in front of the other clue-giver if it is one of theirs, or else in a neutral pile. If a card is guessed correctly, the guessing team can choose to continue and make an additional guess. As long as you continue to guess correctly, you can keep guessing.</p>

<p>When a neutral or the other player’s color is selected that clue-round ends, and the other clue giver takes another turn.</p>

<h3>Rules about giving clues</h3>
<div class="content">
<ul>
<li>Your word or word phrase clue should be about the meaning of the words or the picture on the card. Your clue should <i>not</i> be about the position of the cards (e.g., left side), about the suit or number of the card (e.g. Diamonds, Spades, or Jack), or about the starting letter of the card (e.g. P to clue Paddleboarding and Palindrome). </li>
<li>Your clues should be English words. No fair giving a French word to clue a card, unless it is a common English expression.</li>
<li>You can’t say any form of the words that are currently on the board.</li>
<li>If you give a 2-word phrase, the words must go together and not be 2 random separate clues to 2 separate words. If there is a common two-word word phrase that happens to give different information, than the clue is fine. For example, Sourpatch Kids is a common phrase that might get someone to select Apple Cider Vinegar and Ender’s Game &mdash; though it could totally fail as a clue as well.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p>Remember, for the game to be most successful, the clue-giver should not give non-verbal clues and should remain straight-faced throughout the game. When an unexpected card is selected, do not reveal if the card selected was the intended one.</p>

<p>When the game is over, feel free to discuss what you meant by your clues and laugh about any misunderstandings or unexpected associations.</p>

<p>Both teams will be able to give the same number of clues. If the Blue team gets their 6th card, their turn ends and the Green team gets one last chance to tie. If the Green team is the first team to 6, the game just ends with them as the winner (both teams would have had an equal number of clues, since Blue always starts).</p>

<p>If the game ends tied, then you should play a quick game of Tie-Breaker.</p>

<div class="game-rules" id="tiebreaker">

<input id="tiebreaker-toggle" type="checkbox" class="checkbox-toggle" />
<label for="tiebreaker-toggle" class="fa"></label>

<h2>Tie-Breaker</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>Play this quick game if any other game you have ends up as a tie.  Select the next card of the deck and then tell the group a true story about yourself that involves the word on the card. Someone on the other team (or other tied winner) tells a true story that involves themselves and the card. If you can weave in the Bride or Groom in your (true) story, all the better. The other players choose a winner from the two stories. If they declare a tie, place another round of Tie-Breaker.</p>

    <label for="and-then-toggle" class="fa"></label>

    <h2>And Then…</h2>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Tell an interactive story using the pictures or words from a card.
    To play deal everyone 3 cards and then flip a random card from the deck to start. The first person starts with:
    <blockquote class="quote">Once upon a time…</blockquote>
    and starts a story that has something to do with the flipped card. After a sentence or 2, the next person in the circle will lay a card from their hand down and add to the story. After 3 times around the table, the last person wraps up the story with their last card.</p>

<div class="game-rules" id="Lui-O">
    <input id="lui-o-toggle" type="checkbox" class="checkbox-toggle" />
    <label for="lui-o-toggle" class="fa"></label>

    <h2>Lui-O</h2>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Be the first to get rid of your cards by following suit or rank to the discard pile. Youngest player goes first. Deal 5 cards to each player and then start a discard pile by flipping the next card. The first player needs to play a card that matches either the suit (hearts, spades, clubs, or diamonds) or rank (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, etc). When you play a card, <b>share something to the group</b> about the word or picture. Start playing clockwise around the table. The following cards are special:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ace</b>: Wild cards that can be played on your turn to change the suit</li>
        <li><b>King</b>: Reverse the direction of play</li>
        <li><b>2</b>: Next player must draw 2 cards and skip a turn</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you are down to your last card, you must say "Johnny and Abi" or draw a penalty card.</p>
    <p>The winner of the game is the first one out. They get to come up with a new rule for future games of Lui-O. Rules could include adding to the special cards, forcing a motion or action if something happens, or any creative thing you can think of.</p>
